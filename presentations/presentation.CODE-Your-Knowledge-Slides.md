# **C.O.D.E. Your Knowledge**

## A Software Engineer's Attempt at Documentation

**Johannes Prinz**
[Wellington .NET User Group](https://www.meetup.com/wellidotnet/events/308565157/)

# The Story Hook

```bash
$ git log --oneline -1
a1b2c3d Fix critical bug in payment processing

$ git blame PaymentProcessor.cs
a1b2c3d (Johannes Prinz 6 months ago) // TODO: This is a hack
```

**Who wrote this?** 🤔  
**Why did I do that?** 😱

# The Problem

> **"Software is the manifestation of what we know"**
>
> — Harold Abelson, MIT

But are we truly converting **information** into lasting **knowledge**?

Or just leaving behind:

- 💭 Cryptic comments
- 📄 Outdated READMEs
- 🤷‍♂️ "It works on my machine" documentation

---

# What Is Software Engineering?

We are **knowledge workers** creating solutions through:

- 🎯 **Learning** - Understanding requirements and domains
- 🔬 **Experimentation** - Play and exploration drive innovation
- 🏗️ **Building** - Turning complex requirements into elegant code
- 📚 **Knowledge Creation** - Capturing the why, what, and how

_Knowledge will outlive the programming languages we encode it in._

---

# The Opportunity

What we **do** changes much slower than **how** we do it.

- Frameworks come and go
- Languages evolve
- Tools change daily

**But principles endure.**

Let's architect for **changeability** and **knowledge preservation**.

---

# Your Outcomes Today

You'll walk away with:

✅ **Concepts** - New ways to think about documentation  
✅ **Principles** - Guidelines that transcend tools  
✅ **Frameworks** - Structured approaches to knowledge capture  
✅ **Tools** - Practical solutions you can use tomorrow

_And maybe even enjoy writing documentation a little bit more!_ 😊

# The C.O.D.E. Method

<!-- cspell:disable -->

**C**ollect → **O**rganise → **D**evelop → **E**xpress

<!-- cspell:enableable -->

_From unstructured information to structured knowledge_

# The Magic: Aggregators & Augmenters

Transform scattered information into structured knowledge:

- 📊 **Aggregators** - Collect from multiple sources
- 🔍 **Summarizers** - Extract key insights
- ⚡ **Augmenters** - Add context and relationships
- 🔄 **Automators** - Keep documentation current

_Example: Git blame + LDAP + Documentation = Context-rich code exploration_
