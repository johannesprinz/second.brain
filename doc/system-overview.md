# System Architecture Overview

## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the software system
architecture as visualized through Structurizr. The system demonstrates the
relationships between users, software systems, and their internal components.

## System Landscape

### Stakeholders

#### Users

- **Primary Actor**: End users who interact with the software system
- **Role**: Consumers of the system's functionality and services
- **Interaction Pattern**: Direct usage through the web application interface

### Software Systems

#### Main Software System

The core software system provides the primary business functionality and
consists of multiple containers working together to deliver value to users.

**Key Characteristics:**

- Web-based architecture
- Data persistence layer
- User-facing interface
- Scalable container-based design

## Container Architecture

### Web Application Container

- **Purpose**: Primary user interface and application logic
- **Technology**: Web-based application framework
- **Responsibilities**:
  - User authentication and session management
  - Business logic processing
  - API endpoints for client interactions
  - User interface rendering

### Database Container

- **Purpose**: Data persistence and management
- **Type**: Database system (tagged as "Database")
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Data storage and retrieval
  - Data integrity and consistency
  - Query processing and optimization
  - Backup and recovery capabilities

## System Interactions

### User → Web Application

- **Relationship**: "Uses"
- **Description**: Users interact directly with the web application to access
  system functionality
- **Interface**: HTTP/HTTPS web interface
- **Authentication**: Required for secure access

### Web Application → Database

- **Relationship**: "Reads from and writes to"
- **Description**: Bidirectional data flow for persistence operations
- **Operations**:
  - **Read Operations**: Data retrieval, queries, reporting
  - **Write Operations**: Data creation, updates, deletions
- **Protocol**: Database-specific connection protocols

## Architectural Principles

### Design Patterns

- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between presentation, business
  logic, and data layers
- **Container-Based Architecture**: Modular design with distinct
  responsibilities
- **Database Abstraction**: Isolated data layer for flexibility and
  maintainability

### Quality Attributes

- **Scalability**: Container-based design supports horizontal scaling
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of responsibilities
- **Security**: User authentication and data protection
- **Reliability**: Robust data persistence layer

## Visual Representation

### System Context Diagram (Diagram1)

- **View Type**: System Context
- **Layout**: Left-to-right auto-layout
- **Scope**: Shows the software system in relation to its users
- **Purpose**: High-level overview of system boundaries and external
  interactions

### Container Diagram (Diagram2)

- **View Type**: Container View
- **Layout**: Left-to-right auto-layout
- **Scope**: Internal structure of the software system
- **Purpose**: Detailed view of system components and their relationships

## Styling and Visual Design

### Color Scheme

- **Users/People**: Red background (#d34407) with person shape
- **Software Systems**: Orange background (#f86628)
- **Containers**: Light orange background (#f88728)
- **Database Elements**: Cylinder shape for visual distinction
- **Text**: White text (#ffffff) for contrast and readability

### Visual Conventions

- **Shape Coding**: Different shapes represent different element types
- **Color Coding**: Consistent color scheme for element categories
- **Auto-layout**: Automatic positioning for clear relationship visualization

## Demo Points for Structurizr

### Key Features to Showcase

1. **Interactive Diagrams**: Click through different views (System Context →
   Container)
2. **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear representation of system boundaries and
   relationships
3. **Documentation Integration**: Embedded documentation accessible from
   diagrams
4. **Responsive Design**: Auto-layout adapts to content changes
5. **Export Capabilities**: Generate diagrams in multiple formats

### Demonstration Flow

1. **Start with System Context**: Show high-level user-system relationship
2. **Drill Down to Containers**: Reveal internal system structure
3. **Highlight Relationships**: Demonstrate data flow and interactions
4. **Show Documentation**: Access embedded documentation from diagram elements
5. **Export Options**: Generate PNG/SVG for presentations or documentation

## Technical Implementation

### Structurizr Configuration

- **Scope**: Software System level
- **Identifier Strategy**: Hierarchical naming
- **Documentation Path**: `doc/` directory
- **ADR Integration**: `doc/adr/` for architecture decisions

### File Structure

```

## Next Steps

### Potential Enhancements

1. **Add more containers**: API Gateway, Cache Layer, Message Queue
2. **Include deployment views**: Show infrastructure and environments
3. **Add dynamic views**: Demonstrate user journeys and system workflows
4. **Expand documentation**: Add component-level details and interfaces

### Integration Opportunities

- **CI/CD Integration**: Automatic diagram generation on code changes
- **Team Collaboration**: Shared understanding through visual architecture
- **Decision Documentation**: Link ADRs to specific system components
- **Onboarding**: Use diagrams for new team member orientation
