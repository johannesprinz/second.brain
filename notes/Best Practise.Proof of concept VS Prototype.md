# Proof of Concept (PoC) vs. Prototype

A **Proof of Concept (PoC)** and a **Prototype** both help validate ideas in
software development, but they serve different purposes and stages in the
development process.

## 1. Proof of Concept (PoC)

âœ… **Goal:** Validate feasibility of an idea or technology.  
âœ… **Focus:** Proving that a specific concept or technology **can work**.  
âœ… **Scope:** Small-scale, often a disposable experiment.  
âœ… **Users:** Internal stakeholders (e.g., engineers, architects).  
âœ… **Example:** Testing whether a new AI model can accurately classify images
before building a full application.  
âœ… **Output:** A write up of what we were seeking to prove, who was involved,
what we did, what we learnt including any gotcha's, and any information relevant
to taking this forward should this be required, including ball park estimates.

### ðŸ”¹ When to Use a PoC?

- Uncertain whether a technology or approach is viable.
- Need to test a hypothesis before investing resources.
- Demonstrating feasibility to decision-makers.

## 2. Prototype

âœ… **Goal:** Demonstrate how the system will look and function.  
âœ… **Focus:** **User experience, design, and functionality** (but not full
implementation).  
âœ… **Scope:** Interactive, can be partially functional but not
production-ready.  
âœ… **Users:** Designers, developers, business stakeholders, end-users (for
feedback).  
âœ… **Example:** A clickable UI mock of a mobile banking app to test user
navigation.  
âœ… **Output:** Working code albeit not production ready.

### ðŸ”¹ When to Use a Prototype?

- Gathering feedback on UI/UX before development.
- Demonstrating product flow to stakeholders.
- Validating usability before full-scale implementation.

## Key Differences

| Feature           | Proof of Concept (PoC)            | Prototype                                          |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**       | Test feasibility of something     | Test design & usability                            |
| **Audience**      | Internal teams                    | Stakeholders, end users                            |
| **Scope**         | Small, focused on tech validation | Broader, focused on UX/UI and working code         |
| **Functionality** | Often non-functional              | Partially functional but far from production ready |
| **Longevity**     | Disposable after validation       | Can evolve into a minimal viable product           |

## ðŸš€ Analogy

- A **PoC** is like testing if a rocket fuel formula can power a launch.
- A **Prototype** is like building a scale model of the rocket to check its
  design.
