- Deployment Frequency:
  - Measures how often an organization successfully releases to production.
  - High-performing teams aim for frequent, smaller deployments.
- Lead Time for Changes:
  - Measures the time it takes for a code commit to get into production.
  - Shorter lead times indicate a more efficient development process.
- Change Failure Rate:
  - Measures the percentage of deployments that cause a failure in production.
  - Lower change failure rates indicate more reliable releases.
- Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR):
  - Measures the time it takes to recover from a failure in production.
  - Faster recovery times indicate better incident response and resilience.
